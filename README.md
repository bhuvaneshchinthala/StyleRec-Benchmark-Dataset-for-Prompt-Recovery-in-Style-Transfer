# StyleRec-Benchmark-Dataset-for-Prompt-Recovery-in-Style-Transfer
A deep-learning style-transfer system using PyTorch and Hugging Face Transformers. It rewrites transcripts into styles like formal, optimistic, or pessimistic while preserving meaning. Uses RoBERTa-based models, data cleaning, and multiple architectures with automated training, achieving up to 70% accuracy.
